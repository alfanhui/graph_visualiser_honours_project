npTuioClient
============

npTuioClient is a TUIO Client implemented as an NPAPI-based browser
plugin. It uses [reacTIVision's](http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/)
TUIO Client as a base.

The plugin constantly calls a javascript function `tuio_callback`
whenever a new touch event arrives. Having this function called, you
can start using javascript to manipulate HTML, Canvas, SVG, etc in
order to create a multi-touch application!

Check the included examples to see how to use this plugin. Check also
[TUIOjs](http://github.com/fajran/tuiojs/tree/master) to see more
examples.

The plugin has been tested and works on

* Windows XP: Firefox 3.0.10, Google Chrome 2.0.172.33, and Safari 4.0.
* Linux (Ubuntu 8.04): Firefox 3.0.11
* Mac OS X 10.4.11: Firefox 3.5rc3 and Safari 4.0

It doesn't work on Opera 9.64 on Windows XP nor Internet Explorer.

To make the plugin works on Internet Explorer, the plugin has to be
ported (or wrapped) to an ActiveX-based plugin first. This is needed
since Internet Explorer doesn't support NPAPI-based plugin.

Download
--------

* [Windows](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/fajran/npTuioClient/npTuioClient-0.2-win.zip)
* [Linux](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/fajran/npTuioClient/npTuioClient-0.2-linux.tar.gz) (Ubuntu 8.04 i386)
* [Mac OS X](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/fajran/npTuioClient/npTuioClient-0.2-mac.zip)

Compilation
-----------

### Windows

Open the Visual C++ project/solution file and build. I use Visual C++
2008 Express Edition.

### Linux

Go to the project directory and type `make`.

### Mac OS X

Open the Xcode project and build. I use Xcode 2.5 under Mac OS X 10.4.11.

Installation
------------

### Windows

Put the plugin file `npTuioClient.dll` under Firefox'/Mozilla's
`plugin` directory. Mine is `C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\Plugins`.

If you are using Google Chrome, put the plugin under
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\Plugins`. Create the
directory if necessary.

### Linux

Put the plugin file `npTuioClient.so` under `~/.mozilla/plugins`.

### Mac OS X

Put the plugin bundle `npTuioClient.plugin` under `~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/`.

Usage
-----

Install the plugin, open one of the example files on your browser and
start using your multi-touch display!

You can open multiple tabs or windows as long as they belong to the
same browser instance. The plugin can't be used from multiple browsers
at a time. This is because the TUIO Client library can only be started
once at a time.

Issues
------

* Firefox on Mac OS X crashes when the plugin is unloaded (all pages
  that use the plugin are closed). This doesn't happen on Safari 4.0.
  
  TODO: check plugin's shutfown and bundle unloading.

* Firefox on Linux can't cleanly close the TUIO connection. So, the
  browser has to be restarted if the plugin want to be loaded again.
  
  TODO: check TUIO Client's stop function.
